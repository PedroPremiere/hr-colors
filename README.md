# hr-colors

Answers for HR tasks.
As I received multiple tasks for HR, I decided to combine some of them into one project that meets criteria  

- FrontEnd: Contains React Developer tasks -  React frontend page with colors upload. Tests in Cypress + StoryBook. No Redux used (it was required in one task) 
- BackEnd: Contains answer Backend tasks - simple CRUD with Swagger connected to Dynamo DB. Tests in Jest.
- Mobile: ReactNative App using Expo.

All sub-projects are connected and both use TypeScript.
